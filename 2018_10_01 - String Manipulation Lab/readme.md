String Manipulation Lab
=
The user is to enter their full name, both first and last names â€“ as a SINGLE string. Use methods (`getLength`, `getFirst`, `getLast`, `getInitials`, `getNickName`) to calculate the length of the string (full name), display the first name, last name, initials, and a nickname.

The results should be displayed where ONLY the first letter of each word is uppercase; all other letters are lowercase.
