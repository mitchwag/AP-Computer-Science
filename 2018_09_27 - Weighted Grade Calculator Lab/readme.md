For this assignment, write a program that will input a set of grades and compute a weighted average.

The program should input 3 test scores (as doubles), 2 quiz scores (as ints) and a homework average (as a double).

The program should then output the test average, quiz average and final grade (as doubles).

The final grade should be a weighted average. Count the test average as 40% of the final grade, the quiz average as 35% of the final grade and the homework average as 25% of the final grade.

If you notice that your Final Grade output is off by a very small amount, this may be due to roundoff error which we will discuss in an upcoming lesson.
